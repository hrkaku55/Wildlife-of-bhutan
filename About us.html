<p>I am a student of lungtenzampa middle secondary school, i made this website because people are not aware of the importance of Biodiversity in our country interms of Economy, religous beliefs, and how it impacts our health</p>
<p>Biodiversity is crucial for Bhutan because it supports the countrys rich natural heritage and is deeply intertwined with its cultural and spiritual identity. Bhutan's diverse ecosystems, ranging from tropical forests to alpine meadows, provide vital resources such as clean water, medicinal plants, and raw materials for local communities. These ecosystems also play a key role in regulating the climate, maintaining soil health, and preventing natural disasters like floods and landslides. As a predominantly rural nation, many Bhutanese people depend directly on biodiversity for their livelihoods, making the preservation of these ecosystems a matter of both cultural and economic importance.

    Additionally, Bhutan has made environmental conservation a cornerstone of its national policies, particularly through its commitment to maintaining a carbon-negative status and its unique Gross National Happiness (GNH) framework. By prioritizing biodiversity conservation, Bhutan ensures the resilience of its ecosystems in the face of climate change and habitat destruction. Protecting biodiversity also helps maintain the balance of the nationâ€™s traditional ways of life, where people live in harmony with nature. Bhutan's leadership in environmental conservation not only serves its own citizens but also sets an example globally for sustainable development and the importance of preserving biodiversity for future generations.
